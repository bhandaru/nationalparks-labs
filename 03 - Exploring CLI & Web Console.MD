# Exploring the CLI and Web Console  

## Command Line  

The first thing we want to do to ensure that our oc command line tools was installed and successfully added to our path is to log in to the OpenShift environment that has been provided for this Workshop session.
	
___
:information_source:  
In case you had trouble installing the command line tools, you can go ahead and use a hosted version running in our OpenShift cluster. Open a new browser tab and point it to:

```http://terminal-ocp-workshop.apps.osevg.openshiftworkshop.com```

You will need to log in with your OpenShift user and click on Allow selected permissions. You can then continue with the workshop.
___

In order to log in, we will use the oc command and then specify the server that we want to authenticate to. Issue the following command:

```
oc login  https://api.cluster-dfw-a75a.dfw-a75a.example.opentlc.com:6443
```

You may see the following output:

```
The server uses a certificate signed by an unknown authority.
You can bypass the certificate check, but any data you send to the server could be intercepted by others.
Use insecure connections? (y/n):
```

Enter in **Y** to use a potentially insecure connection. The reason you received this message is because we are using a self-signed certificate for this workshop, but we did not provide you with the CA certificate that was generated by OpenShift. In a real-world scenario, either OpenShift’s certificate would be signed by a standard CA (eg: Thawte, Verisign, StartSSL, etc.) or signed by a corporate-standard CA that you already have installed on your system.
	
___
:information_source:  
On some versions of Microsoft Windows, you may get an error that the server has an invalid x.509 certificate. If you receive this error, enter in the following command:  
```
oc login https://api.cluster-dfw-a75a.dfw-a75a.example.opentlc.com:6443 --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true
```
___  

Once you issue the oc login command, you will be prompted for the username and password combination for your user account. Use the username and password combination provided to you by the instructor of this workshop:

```
Username: userXY
Password: openshift
```

:congratulations: Congratulations, you are now authenticated to the OpenShift server.  

The OpenShift master includes a built-in OAuth server. Developers and administrators obtain OAuth access tokens to authenticate themselves to the API. By default your authorization token will last for 24 hours. There is more information about the login command and its configuration in the [OpenShift Documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/welcome/index.htmlhttps://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/welcome/index.html).

Once you have authenticated to the OpenShift server, you will see the following confirmation message:

```
Login successful.
Using project "userXY".
```	

If you don’t have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running the command below. Replace ```<projectname>``` with ```<userXY```  
```
oc new-project <projectname>
```


## Using a Project

Projects are a top level concept to help you organize your deployments. An OpenShift project allows a community of users (or a user) to organize and manage their content in isolation from other communities. Each project has its own resources, policies (who can or cannot perform actions), and constraints (quotas and limits on resources, etc). Projects act as a "wrapper" around all the application services and endpoints you (or your teams) are using for your work.

During this lab, we are going to use a few different commands to make sure that things in the environment are working as expected. Don’t worry if you don’t understand all of the terminology as we will cover it in detail in later labs.

If you didn’t have a project already created for you, the first thing we want to do is create the userXY project. You can do this with the following command:

___  
:information_source: In the following command, replace userXY with the project provided to you.
___  
```oc new-project userXY```

You will see the following confirmation message:

```
Now using project "userXY" on server "https://api.cluster-dfw-a75a.dfw-a75a.example.opentlc.com:6443".
```

If you had multiple projects, the first thing you would want to do is to switch to the userXY project to make sure you’re on the correct project from now on. You can do this with the following command:  
___  
:information_source: In the following command, replace userXY with the project provided to you.
___  
```
oc project userXY
```

You will see the following confirmation message:

```
Now using project "userXY" on server "https://api.cluster-dfw-a75a.dfw-a75a.example.opentlc.com:6443".
```
___  

## The Web Console

OpenShift ships with a web-based console that will allow users to perform various tasks via a browser. To get a feel for how the web console works, open your browser and go to the following URL:

http://console-openshift-console.apps.cluster-dfw-a75a.dfw-a75a.example.opentlc.com

The first screen you will see is the authentication screen. You will be prompted for the username and password combination for your user account. Use the username and password combination provided to you by the instructor of this workshop:

```
Username: userXY
Password: openshift
```

![OpenShift Login Screen](https://github.com/bhandaru/nationalparks-labs/blob/master/images/Login.png)

After you have authenticated to the web console, you will be presented with a list of items that you can add to your project. This is called the service catalog. You will see something that looks like the following image:

Explore the site!!

<!--
Click on the userXY project on the right hand side of the screen. When you click on the userXY project, you will be taken to the project overview page which will list all of the routes, services, deployments, and pods that you have running as part of your project. There’s nothing there now, but that’s about to change.

When the provided cluster has metrics aggregation capabilities configured you might see an error in the web console (when the cluster uses self signed certificates):
Web Console

Click the link that says Open metrics URL, and accept the certificate.
Acept Certificates

We need to accept another self-signed certificate for OpenShift’s metrics aggregation. If we don’t, then the metrics will not display in the OpenShift UI.
Hawkular web

We will be using a mix of command line tooling and the web console for the labs. Get ready!
